The Matrix is one of the best science fiction action film directed by The Wachowski Brothers. The film has influenced both the cinema industry and the computer entertainment industry. When you watch The Matrix for the first time, it looks like perfect action movie with high-class special effects and good actors.Time passed and we remember only a black cloak, two hands shooting, kung-fu and running on the walls. Recently I watched it again and I was amazed that there was so much hidden behind the spectacular scenes that I needed to watch this film several times, and I would probably find something that I had missed earlier. Reality is the only what we see and feel. We can understand the movie in different ways. You will see what you emphasize. Slavery, the fight against the system, the role of man in this system and the system in life, fanaticism and faith, chosenness and resurrection.I suggest watching The Matrix even if you've already watched it.
