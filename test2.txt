I honestly don't know who thought that this movie would be a good idea. It is a complete train wreck for multiple reasons. One of the biggest issues is the plot is just nonsense. It is inappropriate to have a man deiced that he will hold a woman captive and she will love him. That is just not ok and i don't know why they made a movie romanticising this idea. The male character is a creep. He assaults the female character multiple times and it is not shown as a bad thing. It's just like he is a man and he has power so he can do what he likes. It is really really bad. Beyond that they just do variations of the same scene 6 different times. This movie is just the same scene over and over again broken up with random montages with a song played over it. The actions of the characters are nonsensical too. She has been kidnapped in a foreign country and then the next day there is a shopping montage where she is just like "woo lets go buy some new clothes". Like that just wouldn't happen, you would be terrified and she just acts like fine with it. I feel like they try to get the audience on side by making her current boyfriend a horrible person. I think they think the audience will be like "oh that's good she got away from him". Yeah she did get away from her bad boyfriend...by being kidnapped by an Italian mobster who is holding her captive???? The second issue is the leads can't act and a lot of the movie is just them interacting so its like watching an amateur dramatics troupe half of the time. Now i can't work this out but this woman who is kidnapped never seems scared like at all. I can't deiced if this was the direction she was given or she just can't act or the script said she isn't scared. She literally wakes up after being kidnapped and tried to open the door to get out, can't because its locked and is just like "Yeah fair enough" and just sits down like this happens every day. On top of that the scenes with the male lead pushing her against walls and stuff she pulls like "Posing, modelling" faces and is not like "Jesus Christ the man is assaulting me help". Once again was this the direction or was it the acting who's knows? It also relies heavily on "Pop" songs that are really loud and unnecessary. They constantly play one after the other and then when reading i found out the male lead sung like a big chunk of them so i guess production was just like "well he will give us them cheep let's throw them all in". I could go one about all its problems but it all circles back to the directing, acting and the script. It was just a perfect storm. Believe it or not it is watchable but in a way that you want to watch it to see the disaster. It is the no1 viewed film on a large amount of different countries Netflix's at the moment and i believe this to be the reason. So its really up to you if you want to watch it. It is very boring but also a train wreck.
