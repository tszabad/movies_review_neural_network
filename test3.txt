Story: Somewhat sub-par plot that was almost entirely illogical. Seemed to wander about aimlessly to me... and a friend who was watching it with me managed to fall asleep. I'd average it at 2/10 - it would actually be 1/10 but I gave it an extra 1 point because I never really expect an action flick to have much of a story anyway. Action: Err... for an action flick, there was an odd lack of action and way too much talking; especially from Mickey Rourke. Even the bits that did have action were disappointing to me - except for the opening scene which gave me high hopes and then proceeded to sink like a stone. Props for having a cameo by Willis and the Governator... If anybody asks, I'd tell them to not bother going to the cinema and just rent the Expendables off Netflix or whatever DVD rental company you prefer whenever it does go to DVD.
